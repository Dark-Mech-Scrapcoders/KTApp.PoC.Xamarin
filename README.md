# KTApp.PoC.Xamarin

A proof of concept to evaluate the feasability of using the .NET technology stack for the development of KTApp.

The goal is to develop a cross-platform service library to handle the communication with the dblite database with EFCore and to re-use the same code between all platforms.

See if Xamarin plays fair with said service library for the mobile development portion of KTApp (aka if EFCore is fine).

Find and evaluate possible cross-platform technology for the development of a desktop app using the services that we develop.
